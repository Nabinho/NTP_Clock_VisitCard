# NTP_Clock_VisitCard

Linkit 7697 based NTP Digital Clock with a Visti Card PCB

I have the idea of creating an Visit Card to promote myself as a Software and Hardware Developer and project consultant, and for that I decided to go with a PCB in the format of a Credit Card. The circuit chosen is a project I always wanted to build, as I donÂ´t have clocks due to the time to time need for manual calibration. So I connected the LinkIt 7697 (unfortunately discontinued) I had available, to connect it to a NTP server, and be always up to time. The board then controls 4 7-digits displays by 4 4511 ICs that are indirectly driven by ULN2003 transistors.

If you are interested in building your own Visit Card based on this project, feel free to change the PCB file with your own information. Just remember to give some credit.
